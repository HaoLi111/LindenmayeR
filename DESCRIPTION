Description: Lindenmayer or L-systems are parallel rewriting systems which can
    be used to simulate biological forms and certain kinds of fractals.
    Briefly, in an L-system a series of symbols in a string are replaced
    iteratively according to rules to give a more complex string composed of
    the same symbols. Eventually, the symbols are translated into turtle
    graphics for plotting.  Wikipedia has a very good introduction:
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system This package provides basic functions for
    exploring L-systems.
